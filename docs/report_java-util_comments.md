Report for java-util repository:

1. **Files and Classes:**
- The repository contains 193 Java files, each strictly following the "one class per file" convention.
- Maximum Inheritance Depth: 3 — a moderate value, suggesting limited but intentional use of inheritance hierarchies.
- Average Inheritance Depth: 1.16 — indicates that most classes have minimal inheritance (e.g., directly extend Object or have 1–2 parent classes). This reflects a preference for composition or simple class hierarchies.
2. **Methods:**
- Average methods per class: 10.18 — slightly higher than typical Java projects, suggesting classes with focused but multifaceted responsibilities.
- Maximum methods per class: 344 — a critical outlier, likely a "God Class" violating the Single Responsibility Principle. This class may require  refactoring to split functionality.
- Average Lines of Code per class: 19.58 — concise for Java, indicating generally compact and focused classes. The maximum LOC (2175) reveals at least one extremely large class, potentially combining multiple responsibilities or containing verbose implementations (data structures, autogenerated code).
3. **Complexity:**
- Average cyclomatic complexity: 1.71 — very low, implying simple control flow in most methods (getters/setters, utility functions).
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 51 — a significant outlier, which may signal a highly complex method with nested conditionals, loops, or business logic. This method is a maintenance risk and should be simplified.
