Report for [plantuml](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml) repository:
1. **Files and Classes**: 
    - The repository contains 3405 Java files, each corresponding to a single class, adhering to the "one class per file" standard.
    -  Maximum Inheritance Depth: 7 levels — a relatively high value, typical for complex hierarchies (frameworks or legacy code).
    - Average Inheritance Depth: 1.65 — a low value, indicating that most classes directly inherit from base classes (like Java’s Object) or have 1-2 inheritance levels.


2. **Methods:**
    - The average number of methods per class (5.81) is moderate, but the maximum (269 methods) suggests potential "God Class" that need refactoring.
    - Lines of Code is measured per method: the average (2.2 lines) is exceptionally low, indicating highly fragmented code. The maximum (67 lines) points to oversized methods that should be split in case if it doesn't contain comments. Java encourages small methods for readability. An average of 2.2 lines is unusually low, even for Java. Possible reasons:
        - Over-decomposition (trivial operations split into separate methods).
        - Autogenerated code (getters/setters, wrapper methods).
        -  Design patterns (e.g., Factory Method) splitting logic.
    - Complexity:
    The average cyclomatic complexity (2.19) is low, reflecting simple control flow in most methods. However, the peak value (116) is very high and probably need to be refactored.
